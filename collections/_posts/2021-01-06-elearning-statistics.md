Due to the wide array of changes and challenges, companies in 2020 had to look for training that was quick to deploy, effective, and affordable. As we move into 2021, these are 36 eLearning statistics that will shape this year and our efforts in the employee training industry.

## 11 workforce statistics in 2021

When it comes to workforce statistics in 2021, one thing is for sure: 2020 was a roller coaster of a year. The growth of online learning was already exploding when partial and full shut-downs sent many employees home to work remotely.

Due to this, we saw the following trends and stats:

1. [Employee burnout](https://allwork.space/2020/10/employee-burnout-has-reached-a-new-high-survey-finds/) reached an all-time high in August 2020
